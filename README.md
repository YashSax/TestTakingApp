# TestTakingApp

This TestTakingApp is a mobile application that allows users to take tests more intelligently, providing statistics about test-taking efficiency in real time.

The app has the capability for users to create and store multiple tests, and, when taking them, the app will provide statistics such as "Average time per question," "Required timer per question to finish with 5 minutes to spare," and other useful bits of information.

As of now, I'm working on honing my UI-building skills, so please pardon my lack of artistic talent.
